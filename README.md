Through IDL project programming, build a simple extension function for ENVI. The Canny detection function can be added to ENVI to accurately depict the edges of the graph.
In this repo I have shared the SAV file of the Canny function, please download it and place it in the ENVI installation document, under the "Extension" folder.
