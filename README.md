# ENVI-Canny-function-by-IDL
Through IDL project programming, build a simple extension function for ENVI. The Canny detection function can be added to ENVI to accurately depict the edges of the graph.
In this repo I have shared the SAV file of the Canny function, please download it and place it in the ENVI installation document, under the "Extension" folder. The original IDL code file has also been uploaded. You can modify it according to your needs. For example, select the corresponding ‘data_type=0~15’ which suitable for your system. And the personalized ‘band’ settings you need.

Below is the use of the Canny function example in ENVI:
